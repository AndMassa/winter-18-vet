# API Endpoint Reference

## Documents

The Vet application manages two types of documents: categories and resources.

## Categories

A category helps to organize resources. A resource is related to a category.

A category contains the following properties:

```json
{
  "_id": "category_basic-needs-assistance",
  "name": "Basic Needs Assistance",
  "desc":
    "BasicNeeds Assistance includes organizations that provide one or more of the following services: shelter facilities for the homeless and for those escaping situations of domestic violence, food/supplemental nutrition resources, and single-transaction emergency financial assistance in cases of involuntary hardship.",
  "type": "category",
  "icon": "restaurant"
}
```
